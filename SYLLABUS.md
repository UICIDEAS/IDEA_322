### Course Format, Zoom Meeting Details

IDEA 322 is a [semi-synchronous class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning) with required, in-person discussions on Wednesdays from 12-2:30 (Art & Exhibition Hall, Room 5202) with the exception of the first day of class (January 8, 2024). One-on-one meetings can be scheduled through Calendly (see info below).

Extensive computer and internet use is required. If you do not have access to a laptop, [you may request to borrow one from the university](https://it.uic.edu/services-support/student-resources/online-learning/).

### Course Description

> Art is seen as the ability to change the world, not by money or force, but by orientation, by radically transforming the “sensible,” or sensory, reality of the eye, ear, taste, touch and smell, which unavoidably results in a change in ideas, understanding and insight. It may be about distancing, it may be about getting closer; sometimes it is irony or camp, sometimes it is a serious attempt to find illuminating concepts and their verbalisations and sometimes it is the need to create new myths or just tell stories. (Juha Varto, Artistic Research Methodology, x)

All artists use some form of research to create artwork, whether their process is intuitive or empirical. How might you introduce different methods of research into your own practice? How might you make use of available archives, design surveys, or develop with people from different disciplinary backgrounds? What are the advantages of group projects, and what are those of individual arts-based research?

This course is an overview of arts-based research as an interdisciplinary, humanistic, and qualitative research methodology. Emphasis will be placed on applied, practice-led research in the realization and refinement of interdisciplinary art projects.

***

### Course Outcomes

1.	Students will be able to review existing literature on a subject in order to identify opportunities for interdisciplinary creative engagement.
2.	Students will be able to select appropriate methods that can serve the process of inquiry.
3.	Students will be able to navigate archives and to translate what they learn into artistic form.
4.	Students will be able to interview subjects and to create surveys that yield the qualitative information they are seeking for an artistic project.
5.	Students will be able to recognize biases and advocacies that affect the research process, and develop ethical research competency, confronting issues of power, advocacy, and participant interaction.
6.	Students will be able to demonstrate effective methods in project planning and time management in long-term creative projects.
7.	Students will be able to demonstrate critical thinking as well as aesthetic approaches to research processes.

### Assessment Methods

* Short projects and class readings will evaluate students’ understanding of how key ideas of digital media practices in design and arts disciplines are materialized through current digital tools and systems.
* Short projects will evaluate students’ understanding of digital media resources in design and arts disciplines.
* Short projects will evaluate the students’ ability to use current digital media tools and systems in design and arts disciplines.
* A website project will evaluate students’ ability to apply computer programming concepts.
* Assigned readings, videos to watch, and audio to listen to will challenge students to think critically about how digital media practices in design and the arts shape technological and cultural conditions in relation to questions of community, personal narrative, privacy, and security.

***

### Course Content and Materials

Pre-recorded lectures, texts, articles, videos, audio clips, as well as additional resources like example files and tutorials, can be accessed on the course GitHub repository under the folder for the current week. You will be responsible for watching, reading, and listening to each week's materials, as their content will be explored further in your weekly assignments and projects.

***

### Git, GitHub

We will make extensive use of Git and GitHub to post writing responses, project files, and as the central hub for course materials.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a file management system primarily used by programmers in software development (and also used by artists, writers, designers, scientists, among many others) that allows them to manage their projects as "repositories" or all-inclusive packages that can be managed and new versions updated ("pushed" to a server) easily. [GitHub](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) is a web service that hosts these repositories. GitHub uses Git, but Git does not necessarily use GitHub.

A free GitHub account is required for this class. [Create an account here](https://github.com/join) and [email me at tfunk4@uic.edu](mailto:tfunk4@uic.edu) with your GitHub username.

### Assignments and Grading

Coursework: (100 points total)
- Warm-up projects: 	10 pts
- Project 1 (Group):
    - Proposal: 		15 pts
    - Presentation: 	20 pts
- Project 2 (Individual):
    - Proposal: 		15 pts
    - Presentation:		20 pts
Participation:			10 pts
Attendance: 			10 pts

Grading Key:

A = outstanding accomplishment in all assignments (technically and conceptually), excellent engagement with ideas and materials, excellent participation in classroom community (vocal, inquisitive, and ALWAYS thoughtful), full attendance, exceptional progress in artistic process  
B = above average accomplishment in all assignments, strong engagement with ideas and materials, work falls short of fully embodying the initial conceptual or formal impetus. during class, you are invested when you choose, but lack the rigor to ALWAYS be present in class. full attendance and above average progress  
C = average accomplishment of all assignments, work submitted on time, some engagement with ideas and materials, some participation in classroom community, full attendance, average progress, Student shows lack of motivation and interest in thoroughly developing their skills as an artist, student, and citizen. 
D = the work does not meet the assignments criteria, some assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner, little engagement with ideas and materials, irregular or damaging participation in classroom community, irregular attendance, minimal progress  
F = a number of assignments not completed or completed in a perfunctory manner, little or no evidence of engagement with ideas and materials, lack of participation in classroom community, failure to arrive prepared for class routinely, irregular attendance, little or no evidence of progress  

*NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of a C or above.

### Revision Policy

After you turn in projects and receive feedback, you will have the chance to revise your assignments using what you've learned. Revised projects can be submitted directly to me by pushing the updated changes to our GitHub repository.

***

### Course Expectations and Course Assignment Policy

This is a four hour course. You should expect to read, watch, or listen to around 4 hours of required course materials per week, in addition to the time it will take to complete assignments. Because of the pace of the course, completing assignments on time is crucial for success.

Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time.  Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness. 

* Maximum: two unexcused absences for the semester.  
* Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.  
* One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused absence.  
* Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.  
* Missing class on a scheduled presentation or critique day is equivalent to not having your work ready. It will result in a failing grade for that assignment. 
* Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.
