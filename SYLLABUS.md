Course description:

Art is seen as the ability to change the world, not by money or force, but by orientation, by radically transforming the “sensible,” or sensory, reality of the eye, ear, taste, touch and smell, which unavoidably results in a change in ideas, understanding and insight. It may be about distancing, it may be about getting closer; sometimes it is irony or camp, sometimes it is a serious attempt to find illuminating concepts and their verbalisations and sometimes it is the need to create new myths or just tell stories. (Juha Varto, Artistic Research Methodology, x)

All artists use some form of research to create artwork, whether their process is intuitive or empirical. How might you introduce different methods of research into your own practice? How might you make use of available archives, design surveys, or develop with people from different disciplinary backgrounds? What are the advantages of group projects, and what are those of individual arts-based research?

This course is an overview of arts-based research as an interdisciplinary, humanistic, and qualitative research methodology. Emphasis will be placed on applied, practice-led research in realization and refinement of interdisciplinary art projects.

Course goals:

1.	Students will be able to review existing literature on a subject in order to identify opportunities for interdisciplinary creative engagement.
2.	Students will be able to select appropriate methods that can serve the process of inquiry.
3.	Students will be able to navigate archives and to translate what they learn into artistic form.
4.	Students will be able to interview subjects and to create surveys that yield the qualitative information they are seeking for an artistic project.
5.	Students will be able to recognize biases and advocacies that affect the research process, and develop ethical research competency, confronting issues of power, advocacy, and participant interaction.
6.	Students will be able to demonstrate effective methods in project planning and time management in long-term creative projects.
7.	Students will be able to demonstrate critical thinking as well as aesthetic approaches to research processes.

*NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of a C or above.  

Attendance Policy:

Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction. When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students are required to remain in class during this independent work time. Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is important that you arrive on time.  Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness. 

•	Maximum: two unexcused absences for the semester.  
•	Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.  
•	One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused absence.  
•	Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.  
•	Missing class on a scheduled presentation or critique day is equivalent to not having your work ready. It will result in a failing grade for that assignment. 
•	Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.  

Contact / Credit Hour Policies:

This class is a 4-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 7-10 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. (For a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis, see the UIC Contact / Credit hour policy.) 

Accommodation for Disabilities:

Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of university life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and physical environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic community.  

UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of disability community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.  

Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413- 0123 (TDD). 

During the first week of the semester a student who has a letter of accommodation (LOA) for any type of disability MUST schedule a meeting with their instructor(s) so that together you may create and agree upon a plan for implementing accommodations.  

Religious Holiday Observance Policy:

In accordance with Illinois state laws and with respect for cultural diversity, we will make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations or requiring student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays. Students who wish to observe their religious holidays must notify the instructor by the tenth day of the term that they will be absent unless their religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day, in such case students must notify instructor at least five days in advance of the date when he or she will be absent. 

Safe Space:

The UIC School of Art & Art History is committed to creating a safe space in our classrooms that is a welcoming, supportive, and safe environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students. See also: UIC’s Nondiscrimination Policy, Open Expressions Policy, and SAAH’s Allyship Booklet.

COVID-19 Safety Protocols and Policies:

All students who will be on campus are required to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if they are able to do so. We acknowledge that some individuals may have medical or religious reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. Students who obtain a COVID-19 vaccination exemption (process to apply for exemption outlined here) will be required to participate in on-campus COVID-19 saliva testing at least twice per 7-day period, 48 hours or more apart; quarantine if exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19; and continue to wear a face mask to participate in classes, activities or events on campus.

For Fall 2022, masks continue to be required in classrooms, lecture centers, research labs, the libraries and learning/success centers, health care settings, and on UIC shuttles and buses. Masking is highly encouraged in other settings, including at events, but it is a choice based on personal risk.  

If students do not follow these guidelines, such as not wearing a mask or not complying with testing requirements, they can be reported to the Dean of Students office via the COVID-19 Non-Compliance Reporting Form.

Student Disciplinary Policy:

The Student Disciplinary Policy is the University's process to handle allegations of misconduct by UIC Students. The Student Disciplinary Policy addresses both academic misconduct (such as plagiarism, cheating, or grade tampering) and behavioral misconduct (such as theft, assault, under-age drinking, and drug-use.) The main purpose of the Student Disciplinary Policy is to ensure that students receive due process—which means that every student should have a fair opportunity to express their side of the story before any decisions are made about their disciplinary case. The Student Disciplinary Policy was designed to be educational in nature.

Cheating:

In accordance with UIC policies, any student caught plagiarizing a paper, any visual material without giving appropriate credit or copying homework will 1) Fail the assignment 2) Be subject to removal from and failure of the course 3) Be reported to the Dean of Students for possible removal from the University.

Image Reproduction:

Images of projects created in this course may be used for educational purposes, including instruction in future courses and promotion of the School, College or University. If you have concerns about sharing or distributing any of your work for these purposes, please discuss these with your instructor. 

Digital Privacy: CADA Policy:

The College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts (CADA) strives to safeguard the privacy of its faculty, students, prospective students, and employees in online events, learning environments, and activities hosted or sponsored within the College. 

Faculty may record and post live online lectures on Blackboard, UIC's internal Content Management System; those recordings are permitted under these guidelines. However, the online meeting host should endeavor to give notice whenever an online class or event is being recorded. If any student is identifiable in an image or recording from an online session, distributing that content publicly (i.e., outside of password protected Blackboard) may constitute a violation of the educational record protections provided under FERPA. Zoom’s guide to FERPA regulations on video conferencing and streaming may be found here: https://explore.zoom.us/docs/doc/FERPA%20Guide.pdf 

Individuals who suspect a violation has occurred should report that matter to Assistant Dean Dina Taylor (dltaylor@uic.edu) or Associate Dean Cheryl Towler Weese (cheryltw@uic.edu).  

Digital Privacy: Lecture Streaming, & Recordings:

Class sessions and related events may be recorded / streamed via Zoom (or a similar platform) for the purposes of study + review or for students who are unable to attend in person. Your instructor will inform you if they plan to record the lecture. The “record” feature for students will be disabled so that no one may be able to record the session without your knowledge. Recording in-class lectures without the permission of the instructor is not permitted.  

If you have privacy concerns and do not wish to appear in lecture recordings, you may turn OFF your video and notify the instructor. If you prefer to use a pseudonym on screen instead of your name, please let the instructor know what name you will be using, so that they can identify you during the class session. If you wish to ask a question but don’t want your name to appear in the chat, you may direct-message the instructor through the chat feature. If you have questions or concerns about this video recording policy, please contact the instructor before the end of the first week of class. 

These guidelines do not restrict a student's right to record lectures or download content pursuant to the assistive technology accommodations outlined by the UIC Disability Resource Center. 

It is also important to maintain a learning environment where everyone feels comfortable participating. To protect these interests, students and other participants may not copy, record, reproduce, screenshot, photograph, or distribute the following content: 

• Live discussions or meetings  
• Discussion boards  
• Rehearsals, Critiques, and other creative activity  
• Images of students, faculty, or other participants 

Any attempt to disrupt an online course or event (e.g., "Zoombombing") or to use the College's online platforms to introduce malware or gain unpermitted access to files or networks is prohibited and may violate other University policies depending on the nature of manner of the conduct. Students who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action under the UIC Student Disciplinary Policy.
