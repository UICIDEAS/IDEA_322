FINAL PROJECT: Charrette Project Proposal

A charrette is an intense period of design or planning activity. 

The word charrette is French for 'cart' or 'chariot'. Its use in the sense of design and planning arose in the 19th century at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where it was not unusual at the end of a term for teams of student architects to work right up until a deadline, when a charrette would be wheeled among them to collect up their scale models and other work for review. The furious continuation of their work to apply the finishing touches came to be referred to as working en charrette 'in the cart'. The term evolved into the current design-related usage in conjunction with working right up until a deadline.

We will be using the contents of the UIC Special Collections to create a proposal for a large-scale project, one you might engage in for a capstone project.

You will create a poster and presentation that will follow this outline for a "Modified Charrette". Refer to the sample poster

A "Modified Charrette" Process for the Interdisciplinary Artist

1. What will be the focus of the Charrette?

+ Initial Design: focuses on setting goals and principles and fleshing out possible design solutions 
that will meet the goals of the project 

+ Implementation: focuses on identifying barriers and developing action plans for implementation 
of identified strategies 

2. What are the Goals of the Charrette?

Our goals with be:
A. To craft a clear and quantifiable deliverable for the project.

- In planning an interdisciplinary project, the main "deliverable"—what you will construct/make/design/perform/etc.—will be central goal.

Example:

I will create and lead a walking tour that explores the history of Jazz in Chicago. This walking tour will be represented by a detailed and annotated map.

I will film a short documentary about urban farming in Chicago. I will premiere this film in a local greenhouse.

- This example gives a concrete deliverable (a map and guided tour, a short documentary film) in two short sentences. 

B. Decide on at least 3 primary/initial resources you will explore.

- These resources should be the most fitting and complete source of information on your topic. For our Modified Charrette, your initial resources will be found in Special Collections.
- Consider the following: is the resource accessible? Do you need special permissions? Are there other resources you need to consider first (outside of Special Collections)?

C. List equipment or other resources you will need, and how you will get these items.

- The UIC Art department has a lot of audio/visual equipment you can borrow.
- What are your software needs? For example, if this is a book or visualization project, do you need access to the Adobe Creative Cloud?
- Consider what the best equipment would be for the project; for example, if your project focuses on sound, source a dedicated sound recorder, and not just your personal smartphone.

Example:

- Video camera: UIC Art Department
- Sound recorder: UIC Art Department
- Editing Software: UIC Daley Library Hub
