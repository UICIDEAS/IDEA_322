  - You may want to consult "The Chicago School of Media Theory" entry on "kitsch": https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mediatheory/keywords/kitsch/.
  - Regarding "Notes on Camp" by Susan Sontag, make sure to look up images of what Sontag refers to — for example, Aubrey Beardsley drawings, Tiffany lamps, the Brown Derby restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in LA, etc. Consider how opinions about these examples have changed, or stayed the same, since 1964.
* Create [a new GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
* Email your GitHub username to: [tfunk4@uic.edu](mailto:tfunk4@uic.edu)
* Create [a new public repository (Step 1 only)](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#repository) and name it 'idea-322-responses-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME'
* Create a new [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#what) file [called 'week-02-camp.md'](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/creating-new-files). Sontag's essay is numbered. Choose three of these numbers and find an image that illustrates the topic of each. Change the file name to your own last name and the number you chose. Using [GitHub markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#what) upload these images, and give the media relevant captions. 
* 'Commit' the new file to your repository with a description. We'll discuss your repositories in discussion on Wednesday, January 24th.

## Unit 2: Collections and Curation

### Week 6
#### Week of February 14, 2024: Institutional Critique // Archives and Museums as Collage

One-on-one meetings this week before midterm grades are submitted

* DOWNLOAD and review [Week 6 guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XouW7bvgChEIB61a3a6Po8bYb54e8tiyePz2U8NSJxw/edit?usp=sharing)
* Read: [Fred Wilson and Howard Halle's Mining the Museum](week_06/wilson_miningthemuseum.pdf)

* Consider the “Museum of Broken Relationships,” and browse the collections on the Public Collectors website: http://www.publiccollectors.org/. What kinds of museums have you visited? What makes a location a museum, or an “attraction”? What is the difference between a curiosity, or a museum display? Find websites for these museums, and search out their mission statements (if they have one). Do you see any patterns? What do you already have that you could make into an archive, or museum? Would it be physical, virtual, or maybe something else? What purpose would this archive/museum serve, if you opened it to the public?
* Invent such a museum. Give it a name, describe its contents, and what its “mission” would be. Provide sketches, if appropriate. 
* Create a .md file in your responses repository for discussion by 10am, Wednesday (2/21).


***

### Week 7
#### Week of February 21, 2024: Eames Office & Speculative Futures

* Read: [Beyond Speculative Design: Past - Present - Futures](week_07/Beyond-Speculative-Design.pdf). (It might seem long, but it includes a lot of pictures and diagrams.)
* Consider the variety of projects described in the text. Which of these projects did you find the most engaging, and why?
* Create a .md file in your responses repository for discussion by 10am, Wednesday (2/28).

***

### Week 8
#### Week of February 28, 2024: Speculative Design

* DOWNLOAD and review [Week 8 guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KMCkrHMrYLEGLtP-cODe_kmSKzUsQAuFMRCQAxepidA/edit?usp=sharing)

* Read the introduction and pick 3 projects to read about in [Beyond Green: Toward a Sustainable Art](/week_08/beyond_green.pdf).
* Create a .md file in your responses folder, and comment on the reading and film: Consider how movements like Afro-Futurism are a kind of Speculative Design; how does science fiction comment upon and critique our present? How are the works included in "Beyond Green" a kind of science fiction? What kinds of narratives might you weave around these objects/projects? Where might you find resources to craft this narrative?

### Week 9
#### Week of March 6, 2024: Speculative Design Part II

***

### Week 10
#### Week of March 13, 2024: Personal Data Visualization

CREATE YOUR OWN PERSONAL DATA VISUALIZATION

Read about Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's data visualization correspondence: http://www.dear-data.com/theproject
What kinds of personal data might you visualize from your own life?

Instructions:
* Collect significant data either from an existing data set (for example, your t-shirt collection, record collection, plants in your home, etc.) OR collect data over the course of a week (number of times you drink a hot beverage, kinds of mail you receive, texts you get on your phone, memes you share, color socks you wear, etc.). It could be anything—it can be silly, or serious.
* Figure out the best—or most interesting—way of visualizing the data. Look at the examples from http://www.dear-data.com/all for inspiration.
* Take a sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper and fold it in half. Complete your visualization on one side, and provide a detailed key on the other.
* Make copies for the class!

Due: APRIL 3rd

NOTES:
* You can hand draw the data, or, if you want, you can make it using photography, Adobe Illustrator / Photoshop, or via collage—it's up to you what is the best/easiest for your project.
* The data doesn't need to be in huge numbers or complicated! If you have a collection of 20 vintage spoons, that is enough data for an interesting visualization (depending on how you choose to visualize it)!
